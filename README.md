Learning about semantic HTML tags

## The Challenge
Checkout this article about semantic HTML:
[semantic html](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
[HTML Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp)


Modify the html inside the body tag to achieve the following:

The whole text is an article inside a recipes website.

It should have the following header, use a title and a caption for the following text:
```
  Spaghetti Recipe
  Classic, easy, delicious!
```

The ingredients should be an unordered list.
```
  Ingredients
    Spaghetti
    Marinara Sauce
    Salt
    Water
```

Instruction should be an ordered list
```
  Instructions
    1. Bring water to a boil.
    2. Add spaghetti to boiling water.
      1. Add salt to taste.
      2. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    3. Add marinara sauce to a pan, bringing to a simmer.
    4. Mix cooked spaghetti with marinara sauce.
    5. Enjoy!
```

It should have a footer that says:
```
  Cooking time: 20min approx.
```

## Installing the project
You should only do this ONCE

```
npm install
```

This will install the dependencies of your project, so you should only run this command whenever you install some new libraries. Don't worry about this for now.

Now you need to make sure the repo is configured to your name and email... it should look something like this:

```
git config --global user.name "Alexandra Zapata Caro"
git config --global user.email "alexa3141@gmail.com"
```


## Running your project
You will need to execute this every time you want to see your project in the browser.
```
npm start
```
This command will start the local server! after it has finished loading you will be able to go to your browser and show off your amazing code to your family and friends.

## Saving your progress

Whenever you want to upload your code to your repo in GitHub, you can use the following commands

```
> git add -A
> git commit -m 'write your commit message here'
> git push
```

`git add -A` will add all the files you have added and modified to the commit
`git add -u` will only add the modified version of the existing files in your project
`git add src/` will be useful if you want to add a specific directory in the commit... in this case `src/` is an example you can use anything you like
`git add src/styles/style.css` will add a specific file to the commit.

`git commit -m 'write your commit message here'` when you use this command you will actually create the commit with all the files that you have added so far. you can add you own commit message, that should be related to the things that you have modified in the project.

`git push` this will upload your commit(s) to GitHub.

## Last words.

Have fun!
